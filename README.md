# SUS

• Install `Pillow` `pycryprodome` and `magic` libraries before running 

# Encrypt.py

• Create a folder named `decrypted_nsfw` because it takes input from there , as usual you can modify it by changing `folder path` in encrypt.py

# Decrypt.py

• Takes input from `encrypted` folder and outputs them to `decrypted_nsfw` folder 

# Extension.py

• `encrypt.py` replaced file extension of all images with `.ganyu` , so use the `extension.py` to add original extensions back

Run this after using `decrypt.py` because it takes input files from there.
